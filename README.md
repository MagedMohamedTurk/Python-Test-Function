# Introduction 
This is a snippet to compactly test a function in python.  
TODO: Describe the snippet in details
This is a snippet purpose is to fast test your Python code.  
Python is OOP language and heavily relay on the function programming.  
What this snippet does is to fetch your code file functions one by one and test them against test cases you specify.  
Test cases are data-based tests that assert the known inputs of a function will return expected outputs.
The snippet make use of `pytest ` package and test cases are expected to be in `config.yaml`

# Requirements
Run the following to up to date with the required packages:  
`pip install requirement.txt`  
# USAGE  
TODO: Write how to use the file to test a function          
`$ git clone https://github.com/MagedMohamedTurk/Python-Test-Function.git`  
`$ cp test.py config.yaml yourWorkingProject/`  
`$ cd yourWorkingProject/`  
`$ pytest test.py -v`  

TODO: Insert screenshots for illustrate the usage of the file
